# Human Voice vs AI Synthesised Voice Classification using Machine Learning.

#### This Project is Completed in MATLAB. All experiments and model traing is performed in MATLAB. 
### Key Terms : Machine Learning, Audio Synthesis, Multimedia Forensics, AI Synthesised Audio, Human Voice, Spectral Analyisis.

In this Project I extracted the features from various audio samples based on Spectral Analysis. Then used those features to identify AI synthesised speech and Human speech using Machine Learning. Trained the various models of Machine Learning like Quadratic and Linear SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression etc. Found the Highest Cross Validation Acuraacy in Quadratic SVM. Able to classify AI synthesised speech from Human speech with accurracy of 98.5 % on test data.
